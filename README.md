They say that good books cannot become old. I can say the same about the books of a unique English writer of the 19th century, Charlotte Bronte. She is one of the best representatives of the English realism trend. My favourite book by Charlotte Bronte is the novel that brought her fame, «Jane Eyre». «Jane Eyre» is an autobiographical novel. The main character is a shy girl, who has, however, a strong will and is independent. From her childhood Jane learned that she could rely only on herself. 
She came from a poor family, studied at Low
ood institution for poor chil­dren, where she had to face m
any difficulties. But she learned to overcome her fears and troubles.
She was also able to sympathize with other people and give a helping hand in a difficult situation.
